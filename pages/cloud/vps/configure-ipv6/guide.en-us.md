## Objective

IPv6 is the latest version of the *Internet Protocol*. Each OVHcloud VPS server is delivered with an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address. However, only IPv4 is configured by default. If you need to configure IPv6, it has to be set up manually on your system.

**This guide explains how to configure IPv6 on your OVHcloud VPS using various methods.**

> OVHcloud is providing you with services for which you are responsible, with regard to their configuration and security. Since we have no administrative access to your devices, it is your responsibility to manage the software and to ensure they function correctly.
>
> This guide is designed to assist you in common tasks as much as possible. Nevertheless, we recommend contacting a specialised provider and/or the software publisher for the service if you encounter any difficulties. We will not be able to assist you ourselves. You can find more information in the “Go further” section of this guide.

## Requirements

- a [Virtual Private Server](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/vps/) in your OVHcloud account
- administrative access (root) via SSH or remote desktop (Windows) to your server
- a basic understanding of networking
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/world/&ovhSubsidiary=we) / to the [OVHcloud API](https://ca.api.ovh.com/console/)

## Instructions

Configuring IPv6 on your VPS is done in multiple steps. At several points in the process you will be prompted to enter commands or to customise configuration files of your server.

Please take note of the following terminology that will be used in code examples and instructions of the guide sections below:

|Term|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|YOUR_IPV6|The IPv6 address assigned to your service|2001:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:yyyy|
|IPv6_PREFIX|The prefix (or *netmask*) of your IPv6 block, usually 128|2001:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::/128|
|IPv6_GATEWAY|The gateway of your IPv6 block|2001:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:zzzz|

### Step 1: Retrieve the necessary network information

The first step is to identify the IPv6 address and the IPv6 gateway assigned to your server. There are two ways of doing this:

- [retrieving the network information via the OVHcloud Control Panel](#viacontrolpanel)
- [retrieving the network information via the OVHcloud API](#viaapi) 

#### Via the OVHcloud Control Panel <a name="viacontrolpanel"></a>

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/world/&ovhSubsidiary=we){.external}, and open the `Bare Metal Cloud`{.action} section. Click `Virtual Private Servers`{.action} in the services bar on the left-hand side, then choose the VPS server concerned.

The IPv6 address and the IPv6 gateway assigned to your server will appear in the `IP` section of the `Home`{.action} tab. Once you have copied them, continue with [applying the IPv6 configuration](#applyipv6).

![configureipv6](images/configure-ipv6-step1.png){.thumbnail}

#### Via the OVHcloud API <a name="viaapi"></a>

On the [OVHcloud API page](https://ca.api.ovh.com/console/) click on `Login`{.action} in the top-right corner. On the following page, enter the credentials of your OVHcloud account.

Use this call to retrieve the IPv6 address assigned to your server:

> [!api]
>
> @api {GET} /vps/{serviceName}/ips
>

The following call allows you to recover the IPv6 gateway assigned to your server:

> [!api]
>
> @api {GET} /vps/{serviceName}/ips/{ipAddress}
>

Once you have retrieved these addresses, continue with [applying the IPv6 configuration](#applyipv6).

### Step 2: Apply the IPv6 configuration <a name="applyipv6"></a>

Once you have gathered the necessary information for the IPv6 configuration, log in to your VPS via SSH. If you require assistance, please refer to this guide: [Introduction to SSH](../../dedicated/ssh-introduction/){.external}.

There are several ways to apply the IPv6 configuration. Use whichever method best suits your situation and requirements:

- [Non-persistent application](#nonpersistent)
- [Persistent application on Debian and its derivatives](#persistentdebian)
- [Persistent application on Red Hat and its derivatives](#persistentredhat)
- [Persistent application on Windows Server](#persistentwindows)

#### Non-persistent application <a name="nonpersistent"></a>

> [!warning]
>
> This configuration will be lost after a restart of your VPS (non-persistent configuration).
>

Connect to your server via SSH and enter the following commands. Take care to tailor these with:

- the network information, retrieved in the previous step (*YOUR_IPV6*, *IPV6_PREFIX* and *IPV6_GATEWAY*)
- the network interface (if your server is not using **eth0**)

```bash
ip addr add YOUR_IPV6/IPV6_PREFIX dev eth0
ip -6 route add IPV6_GATEWAY dev eth0
ip -6 route add default via IPV6_GATEWAY dev eth0
```

#### Persistent application on Debian and its derivatives (Ubuntu, Crunchbang, SteamOS, etc) <a name="persistentdebian"></a>

> [!warning]
>
> Before modifying a configuration file, always create a backup of the original.
>

There are two ways to configure your network depending on the operating system installed on your server:

- **for Debian 8 and earlier, Ubuntu 16.04 and earlier**: use the [method based on the *interfaces* files](#interfaces)

- **for Debian 9, Ubuntu 17.04 and later**: use the [method based on the *Netplan* configuration](#netplan)

In some cases (such as Debian 9), the appropriate method may not be the one specified above. To make sure, browse your system to check which one is active. Visit <https://netplan.io/> for more information, if necessary.<br>
Moreover, keep in mind that the exact file names may vary.

##### Configuration of *interfaces* files <a name="interfaces"></a>

The best practice approach is to create a configuration file in the directory `/etc/network/interfaces.d/`:

```bash
nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/51-cloud-init-ipv6.cfg
```

This allows you to separate the IPv6 configuration and easily revert the changes in case of an error.

Add the following lines to the file. Replace the generic elements (i.e. *YOUR_IPV6*, *IPV6_PREFIX* and *IPV6_GATEWAY*) as well as the network interface (if your server is not using **eth0**) with your specific values.

```
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet6 static
mtu 1500
address YOUR_IPV6
netmask IPV6_PREFIX
post-up /sbin/ip -6 route add IPV6_GATEWAY dev eth0
post-up /sbin/ip -6 route add default via IPV6_GATEWAY dev eth0
pre-down /sbin/ip -6 route del default via IPV6_GATEWAY dev eth0
pre-down /sbin/ip -6 route del IPV6_GATEWAY dev eth0
```

Then restart your network service with one of the following commands:

```bash
service networking restart
```

```bash
systemctl restart networking
```

Alternatively, you can add the configuration above to one of the following files (with *sudo* privileges), depending on the generation of the operating system installed on the server:

- the `/etc/network/interfaces` file
- the `/etc/network/interfaces.d/50-cloud-init.cfg` file

We recommend that you back up up the relevant configuration file. For example, use the following command:

```bash
cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces.back
```

You will then be able to revert the changes, using the commands below:

```bash
rm -f /etc/network/interfaces
cp /etc/network/interfaces.back /etc/network/interfaces
```

##### Configuration using Netplan <a name="netplan"></a>

The network configuration files are located in the `/etc/netplan/` directory. We recommend that you start by backing up the relevant configuration file. In this case, copy the `50-cloud-init.yaml` file using the following commands:

```bash
cd /etc/netplan/
mkdir backup
cp 50-cloud-init.yaml backup/50-cloud-init.yaml
```

You will then be able to revert the changes, using the commands below:

```bash
rm -f /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
cp /etc/netplan/backup/50-cloud-init.yaml /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```

Before editing it, create a copy of the IPv6 configuration file:

```bash
cd /etc/netplan
cp 50-cloud-init.yaml 51-cloud-init-ipv6.yaml
```

Then edit the `51-cloud-init-ipv6.yaml` file, adding the IPv6 configuration of your server. Replace the generic elements (i.e. *YOUR_IPV6*, *IPV6_PREFIX* and *IPV6_GATEWAY*) as well as the network interface (if your server is not using **eth0**) with your specific values.

```yaml
network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
        eth0:
            dhcp6: no
            match:
              name: eth0
            addresses:
              - "YOUR_IPV6/IPv6_PREFIX"
            gateway6: "IPv6_GATEWAY"
            routes:
              - to: "IPv6_GATEWAY"
                scope: link
```

> [!warning]
>
> It is important to respect the alignment of each element in this file as represented in the example above. Do not use the tab key to create your spacing. Only the space key is needed.
>

You can test your configuration using this command:

```bash
netplan try
```

If it is correct, apply it using the following command:

```bash
netplan apply
```

#### Persistent application on Red Hat and its derivatives (CentOS, ClearOS, etc.) <a name="persistentredhat"></a>

The network configuration files are located in the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/` directory. We recommend that you start by backing up the relevant configuration file. For example, copy the `ifcfg-eth0` file using the following commands. Remember to replace **eth0** with your actual interface if necessary.

```bash
cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
mkdir backup
cp ifcfg-eth0 backup/ifcfg-eth0
```

You will then be able to revert the changes, using the commands below:

```bash
rm -f /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
cp /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/backup/ifcfg-eth0 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
```

Then edit the `ifcfg-eth0` file, adding the IPv6 configuration of your server. Replace the generic elements (i.e. *YOUR_IPV6*, *IPV6_PREFIX* and *IPV6_GATEWAY*) with your specific values.

```
IPV6INIT=yes
IPV6ADDR=YOUR_IPV6/IPV6_PREFIX
IPV6_DEFAULTGW=IPV6_GATEWAY
```

**On CentOS 7, you have to create a routing file in addition to the steps above:**

- Create a file (with *sudo* privileges), indicating the default IPv6 routes:

```bash
# touch /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route6-eth0
```

- Edit the file and add the lines below. Replace the generic elements (*IPV6_GATEWAY* and **eth0** interface, if necessary) with your specific values.

```
IPV6_GATEWAY dev eth0
default via IPV6_GATEWAY
```

Finally, restart your network service to allow the system to apply the new configuration with one of the following commands:

```bash
service networking restart
```

```bash
systemctl restart networking
```


#### Persistent application on Windows Server <a name="persistentwindows"></a>

By default, IPv6 is not configured on Windows Servers. To enable it, open the `Control Panel`{.action} and click on `View network status and tasks`{.action}, then on `Change adapter settings`{.action}.

![configureipv6](images/configure-ipv6-step2.png){.thumbnail}

Click on `Ethernet`{.action} to open the settings and click on the `Properties`{.action} button to view the `Ethernet Properties`.

Select `Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)`{.action}, then click on the `Properties`{.action} button.

![configureipv6](images/configure-ipv6-step3.png){.thumbnail}

In the IPv6 Properties window, select `Use the following IPv6 address`{.action}. Enter the IP addresses which you have retrieved in the first step.

You also have the option of entering the IPv6 DNS resolvers of your choice under `Use the following DNS server addresses`{.action}. This is not mandatory if the DNS resolvers of the IPv4 configuration are already functional.

Finally, tick the `Validate settings upon exit` box and click the `OK`{.action} button to validate your changes. An error message may appear if the specified gateway is not on the same IPv6 subnet (/128 and /64 for example). You can ignore this message and continue to the next step regardless.

### Step 3: Verify the configuration and test the connection

To verify that the configuration is functional, there are several possible commands, depending on the operating system.

- **For a GNU/Linux-based system**, here are two examples for the **eth0** interface (to be adapted if necessary):

```bash
ip -6 addr show eth0
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qlen 1000
    inet6 2001:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:zzzz/128 scope global
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::f816:3eff:fec0:c336/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

```bash
ifconfig eth0
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr ab:cd:ef:gf:ij:kl
          inet addr:aa.bb.cc.dd  Bcast:aa.bb.cc.ee  Mask:255.255.255.255
          inet6 addr: 2001:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:zzzz/128 Scope:Global
          inet6 addr: fe80::f816:3eff:fec0:c336/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          [...]
```

To test the connection, you can use the following command:

```bash
ping6 proof.ovh.net
```

- **For a Windows-based system**, use the following command:

```
ipconfig

Windows IP Configuration

Ethernet adapter Ethernet:

   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . : openstacklocal
   IPv6 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 2001:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::zzzz
   Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::d928:7a00:5ba6:951b%3
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 51.xxx.xxx.xxx
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.255
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 2001:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::y
                                       51.xxx.xxx.y
```

To test the connection, you can use the following command:

```
ping -6 proof.ovh.net
```

You can also test the connection to another remote server. However, it is necessary for IPv6 to be active on the remote server for this operation to work.

### Step 4: Disable Cloud-init network management (optional)

> [!primary]

Cloud-init is a package installed by default on a VPS. It functions as a framework to run a script after initially creating your server or rebooting it. The mechanics in place allow the underlying OpenStack infrastructure to inject scripts into the Cloud-init environment and therefore the server configuration.

Depending on the operating system, Cloud-init will manage: the network, the hostname, the resolv.conf file, or the automatic partitioning of the hard disk, in case of an upgrade.

In the case of newer distributions (such as CentOS, Debian 9, Ubuntu 16.x, and later), the default configuration of Cloud-init might sometimes automatically reset the network configuration when the server starts up.

This is relevant for specific use cases in which it is recommended to avoid the reset by disabling automatic network management in Cloud-init. To do this, use the following command to create a file `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/98-disable-network-config.cfg` with the value `network: {config: disabled}`:

```bash
echo "network: {config: disabled}" > /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/98-disable-network-config.cfg
```

> [!warning]
>
> It might be necessary to reboot the server for the change to take effect.
>

In order to return to automatic management of your network by Cloud-init, delete the newly created file or move it to another directory.
