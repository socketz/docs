**Last updated 14th April 2021**

## Objective

IP aliasing refers to a special network configuration for certain OVHcloud services. Failover IPs allow you to associate multiple IP addresses with a single network interface.

**This guide explains how to add failover IP addresses to your network configuration.**

> [!warning]
>OVHcloud is providing you with services for which you are responsible, with regard to their configuration and management. You are therefore responsible for ensuring they function correctly.
>
>This guide is designed to assist you in common tasks as much as possible. Nevertheless, we recommend that you contact a specialist service provider and/or discuss the issue with our community on https://community.ovh.com/en/ if you have difficulties or doubts concerning the administration, usage or implementation of services on a server.
>

## Requirements

- a [Virtual Private Server](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/vps/) in your OVHcloud account
- a [failover IP address](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/bare-metal/ip/) or a failover IP block
- administrative access (root) via SSH or GUI to your server
- basic networking and administration knowledge


## Instructions

The following sections contain the configurations for the most commonly used distributions/operating systems. The first step is always to log in to your server via SSH or a GUI login session (RDP for a Windows VPS). The examples below presume you are logged in as a user with elevated permissions (Administrator/sudo).

> [!primary]
>
Concerning different distribution releases, please note that the proper procedure to configure your network interface as well as the file names may have been subject to change. We recommend to consult the manuals and knowledge resources of the respective OS versions if you experience any issues.
> 

**Please take note of the following terminology that will be used in code examples and instructions of the guide sections below:**

|Term|Description|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|IP_FAILOVER|A failover IP address assigned to your service|169.254.10.254|
|NETWORK_INTERFACE|The name of the network interface|*eth0*, *ens3*|
|ID|ID of the IP alias, starting with *0* (depending on the number of additional IPs there are to configure)|*0*, *1*|


### Debian 10

#### Step 1: Disable automatic network configuration

Open the following file path with a text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg
```
Enter the following line, then save and exit the editor.

```bash
network: {config: disabled}
```
Creating this configuration file will prevent changes to your network configuration from being made automatically.

#### Step 2: Edit the network configuration file

You can verify your network interface name with this command:

```bash
ip a
```

Open the network configuration file for editing with the following command:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/50-cloud-init
```
Then add the following lines:

```bash
auto NETWORK_INTERFACE:ID
iface NETWORK_INTERFACE:ID inet static
address IP_FAILOVER
netmask 255.255.255.255
```

#### Step 3: Restart the interface

Apply the changes with the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart networking
```

### Ubuntu 20.04

The configuration file for your failover IP addresses is located in `/etc/netplan/`. In this example it is called "50-cloud-init.yaml". Before making changes, verify the actual file name in this folder. Each failover IP address will need its own line within the file.

#### Step 1: Disable automatic network configuration

Open the following file path with a text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg
```
Enter the following line, then save and exit the editor.

```bash
network: {config: disabled}
```
Creating this configuration file will prevent changes to your network configuration from being made automatically.

#### Step 2: Edit the configuration file

You can verify your network interface name with this command:

```bash
ip a
```

Open the network configuration file for editing with the following command:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```

Do not change the existing lines in the file; add your failover IP address according to the example below:

```yaml
network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
        NETWORK_INTERFACE:
            dhcp4: true
            match:
                macaddress: fa:xx:xx:xx:xx:63
            set-name: NETWORK_INTERFACE
            addresses:
            - IP_FAILOVER/32
```

> [!warning]
>
> It is important to respect the alignment of each element in this file as represented in the example above. Do not use the tab key to create your spacing.
>

Save and close the file.

#### Step 3: Apply the new network configuration

You can test your configuration using this command:

```bash
sudo netplan try
```

If it is correct, apply it using the following command:

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

Repeat this procedure for each failover IP address.


### Windows Server 2016

#### Step 1: Verify the network configuration

Right-click on the `Start Menu`{.action} button and open `Run`{.action}.

Type `cmd` and click `OK`{.action} to open the command line application.

In order to retrieve the current IP configuration, enter `ipconfig` at the command prompt.

![check main IP configuration](images/image1-1.png){.thumbnail}

#### Step 2: Change the IPv4 Properties

Now you need to change the IP properties to a static configuration.

Open the adapter settings in the Windows control panel and then open the `Properties`{.action} of `Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)`{.action}.

![change the ip configuration](images/image2.png){.thumbnail}

In the IPv4 Properties window, select `Use the following IP address`{.action}. Enter the IP address which you have retrieved in the first step, then click on `Advanced`{.action}.

#### Step 3: Add the failover IP in the "Advanced TCP/IP Settings"

In the new window, click on `Add...`{.action} under "IP addresses". Enter your failover IP address and the subnet mask (255.255.255.255).

![advance configuration section](images/image4-4.png){.thumbnail}

Confirm by clicking on `Add`{.action}.

### cPanel (CentOS 7) / Red Hat derivatives

#### Step 1: Edit the network configuration file

You can verify your network interface name with this command:

```bash
ip a
```

Open the network configuration file for editing:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-NETWORK_INTERFACE:ID
```

Then add these lines:

```bash
DEVICE=NETWORK_INTERFACE:ID
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=IP_FAILOVER
NETMASK=255.255.255.255
BROADCAST=IP_FAILOVER
ONBOOT=yes
```

#### Step 2: Restart the interface

Apply the changes with the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart networking
```


### Plesk

#### Step 1: Access the Plesk IP management section

In the Plesk control panel, choose `Tools & Settings`{.action} from the left-hand sidebar.

![acces to the ip addresses management](images/pleskip1.png){.thumbnail}

Click on `IP Addresses`{.action} under **Tools & Resources**.

#### Step 2: Add the additional IP information

In this section, click on the button `Add IP Address`{.action}.

![add ip information](images/pleskip2-2.png){.thumbnail}

Enter your failover IP in the form `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/32` into the field "IP address and subnet mask", then click on `OK`{.action}.

![add ip information](images/pleskip3-3.png){.thumbnail}

#### Step 3: Check the current IP configuration

Back in the section "IP Addresses", verify that the failover IP address was added correctly.

### Troubleshooting

First, restart your server from the command line or its GUI. If you are still unable to establish a connection from the public network to your alias IP and suspect a network problem, you need to reboot the server in [rescue mode](../rescue/). Then you can set up the failover IP address directly on the server.

Once you are connected to your server via SSH, enter the following command:

```bash
ifconfig ens3:0 IP_FAILOVER netmask 255.255.255.255 broadcast IP_FAILOVER up
```

To test the connection, simply ping your failover IP from the outside. If it responds in rescue mode, that probably means that there is a configuration error. If, however, the IP is still not working, please inform our support teams by creating a support request in your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB) for further investigations.
