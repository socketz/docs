A Docker Registry is a system that lets you store and distribute your Docker images. The best known Registry is the official [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/){.external}, where you can find official public images such as [Alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine){.external}, [Golang](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang){.external} or [Debian](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian){.external}.

Today, OVHcloud allows you to spawn your own authenticated Docker Registry where you can privately store your Docker images. This is the best way to use your private images with our OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes Service offer without exposing them to everyone.
