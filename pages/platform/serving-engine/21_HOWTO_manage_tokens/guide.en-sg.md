## Objective

Managing a **ML Serving namespace** through the **OVHcloud manager** make you an admin of that namespace. However you probably want to delegate access rights and restrictions to other people inside your organization.

This guide guides you through the process of creating tokens for your users.

## Requirements

-   Having previously created a **ML Serving namespace**. Steps are described in section [Initializing namespace](../initialize-namespace)

## Creating a token

### Step 1 - Reach token page

Inside your **ML Serving namespace** page there is a dedicated tab for managing tokens : `Tokens`.

You can start the creation of a new token by clicking the `New Token` button.

### Step 2 - Fill token information

Creating a token requires completing the following information :

-   The authorized `resource(s)` of the token
-   The `user groups` of the token

You can validate the creation of your token by clicking the `Create` button.

### Step 3 - Copy and save your token

A green box indicates that your token has been created correctly. You will find it displayed underneath.

You can choose to give this token to your user or use it yourself to interact with the **ML Serving** platform.

> [!warning]
>
> This is the only moment that the token is diplayed to you. We strongly advise you to save it and store it otherwise you will need to renew it.

## Renewing a token

In the case that a token has been lost or compromised, you can regenerate it directly on the `Token` interface by clicking the `...` button and then `Regenerate`.
