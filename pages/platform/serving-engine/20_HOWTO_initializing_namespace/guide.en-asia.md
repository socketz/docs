## Objective

Before being able to deploy a **machine learning model**, you need to create a namespace on your **public cloud** project. This guide covers this first step.

## Requirements

-   A **public cloud** project

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Go to the ML Serving menu

All actions on the **ML Serving** are made on the `Public Cloud` section of the **OVHcloud control panel** and are located under `Data & Analytics` &gt; `ML Serving`

### Step 2 - Start the creation of a new namespace

Once you read general information and validated this product's contract terms, you can start the creation of a namespace by clicking on the `Create a namespace` button.

### Step 3 - Select the region for your namespace

One or several regions are available for your namespace. Each region corresponds to a physical OVHcloud datacenter. Just select the region in which you want your namespace to be deployed and click `next`.

### Step 4 - Choose a name for your namespace

You can create as many namespaces as you want in your **public cloud** project. Just choose a name identifying your namespace and click `next`.

### Step 5 - Attach your object storage container

Each namespace is linked to a data **container** inside **public cloud object storage**.

You can choose to link to an existing container or create a new one.

### Step 6 - Check that everything is created

Your namespace is now created and you can check general information about it.

You can check that the **data container** was created (if it was not already) by going on the menu under `Storage` &gt; `Object Storage`.

Your container should appear in the list.
