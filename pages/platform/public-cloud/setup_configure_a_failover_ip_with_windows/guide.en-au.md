## Objective

You may need to configure a failover IP address on your instances, for one of the following reasons:

- you have a large number of websites on your instance, 
- you host international projects.

In order to do this you can either buy or import a failover IP address for your Public Cloud instances. 

However failover IPs will not be automatically configured on your instance. 

**This guide explains how to configure your instance's network interface so that a failover IP can be allocated to it.**

## Requirements

- [Make sure you have created an instance in your OVHcloud Control Panel](../create_an_instance_in_your_ovh_customer_account/)
- You must have a failover IP address

## Instructions

### Configuring the interface

Windows does not allow you to configure a failover IP address in addition to configuring a main IP address in DHCP. You therefore have to reconfigure your network card with a manually assigned IP address. 


- Recover network information using "ipconfig":


![windows failover ip](images/img_3609.jpg){.thumbnail}


- Go to the Control Panel then the Network and Sharing Centre


![windows failover ip](images/img_3602.jpg){.thumbnail}


-  Modify the card's parametres:


![windows failover ip](images/img_3603.jpg){.thumbnail}


- Access your interface's properties:


![windows failover ip](images/img_3604.jpg){.thumbnail}


- Access the TCP/IPv4 configuration


![windows failover ip](images/img_3605.jpg){.thumbnail}


- Complete your configuration manually, and use a similar configuration to the one shown below by adapating the IP addresses according to the information obtained from your "ipconfig", and then click on "Advanced:


![windows failover ip](images/img_3606.jpg){.thumbnail}


- Add your failover IP as follows:


![windows failover ip](images/img_3607.jpg){.thumbnail}
