## Obiettivo

OVHcloud offre una varietà di sistemi operativi e applicazioni preinstallate su VPS e Public Cloud. Come provider, ci assicuriamo che le immagini che proponiamo ai nostri clienti siano aggiornate, il che significa che pubblichiamo regolarmente nuove immagini. La trasparenza è fondamentale per OVHcloud e intendiamo informare i nostri clienti sulle modifiche apportate ad ogni immagine all'interno di qualsiasi nuova versione. Questa pagina ti permette di seguire il report delle modifiche (changelog) delle nostre immagini.

## Prerequisiti

Questa guida si applica esclusivamente alle soluzioni [VPS](https://www.ovhcloud.com/it/vps/compare/) e alle istanze [Public Cloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com/it/public-cloud/compute/).

## 2021 Changelog

In questa sezione viene mostrato il changelog per ogni mese del 2021.

### June

```
--- 01 June 2021 ---
Image: All
Product: Public Cloud / VPS
Travaux: https://travaux.ovh.net/?do=details&id=50873
Changelog:
1. Adding new image: Fedora 34
2. Adding new image: Ubuntu 21.04
3. New image property "distro_family" added to each image to help group images into distributions.
4. New image property "hypervisor_type" added to each image which will be used by Nova to filter suitable hosts. This is to prevent spawning images made for QEMU to be spawned on Ironic hosts as they are not compatible.
5. Patch issue with Centos 7 - Plesk and Debian 10 - Plesk image with Lets Encrypt SSL. Plesk will now generate unique hostname for each installation unless there is a valid hostname detected on first boot.
6. General system updates applied to all images.

```

### February

```
--- 03 February 2021 ---
Image: All
Product: Public Cloud / VPS
Travaux: http://travaux.ovh.net/?do=details&id=48820
Changelog:
1. All images contain new package / security updates from vendors since our last image updates
2. Centos 7 - cPanel image: we disabled QEMU Guest Agent on this image due to issues caused by creation of a virtfs when allowing Jailed Shell access. This virtfs cannot be frozen by QEMU Guest Agent and therefore causes a kernel panic. Customers with previous release of this image should check [this guide for fix](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/vps/cpanel_auto_backup/)
