## Definition

The **users** of the AI Training platform are simply your Public Cloud users that you can create in the OVHcloud Control Panel. To give access to **AI Training** to any of your users, you need to grant them the **AI Training Operator** role. Then you can use this user's credentials to authenticate.

**AI Training** includes the OVHcloud Object Storage as a persistent storage solution for your [data](../data). To use these features the user needs to be granted the **Objectstore Operator** role since it implies read/write access to the Object Storage.

### Roles

There are 2 available roles :

-   `AI Training Operator` : Grants access to **AI Training**.
-   `Objectstore Operator` : Grants read/write access to the OVHcloud Object Storage.

## Considerations

-   Access to **AI Training** can be revoked anytime by deleting the user or removing its **AI Training Operator** role.
-   To be able to use the OVHcloud Object Storage, make sure that the user has the **Objectstore Operator** role.

## Going further

-   You can check the [OVHcloud documentation on how to submit a job](../submit-job).
