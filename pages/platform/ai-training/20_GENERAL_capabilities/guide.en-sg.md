## Capabilities and known limits

### Jobs resources and limitations

-   No duration limitation on job execution
-   No limitation on number of parallel execution

You can either choose the number of GPU or CPU for a job, not both.
By default, a job uses one GPU.
The memory resource is not customisable.

If you chose the number of GPU:

-   CPU, memory and local storage resources are not customisable but scaled linearly with each additional GPU.

If you chose the number of CPU:

-   Memory and local storage resource is not customisable but scaled linearly with each additional CPU.

Information about maximum number of CPU/GPU, memory per CPU/GPU and local storage are available with the `ovhai` CLI.

> **Local storage** refers to a drive mounted on the node. It's limited and not the recommended way to handle data, see [OVHcloud documentation on data](../data)
