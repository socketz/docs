## Objective

This guide will tell you how you can monitor you jobs after submitting them. 

In this guide, we are assuming that you're using the [OVHcloud Manager](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB){.external} to use the Data Processing platform and you have already submitted a job. 

To read an introduction about Data Processing service you can visit [Data Processing Overview](../overview){.external}.

## Requirements 

- Access to the [OVHcloud Manager](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB){.external}
- A job that has been already submitted to Data Processing

## Instructions

### Apache Spark Dashboard 

After submitting your job, follow these steps to open its Apache Spark dashboard: 

- Find your job in the list of jobs in the Data Processing page of the OVHcloud Manager.
- Click on the name of the job to open its dashboard.

- Click on  `Open job user interface`{.action} in the **Actions** panel to open the Apache Spark dashboard. If you do this right after submitting a job, you will see a warm up page for a few seconds while your job is starting.

The Apache Spark dashboard for your job will then start automatically.
