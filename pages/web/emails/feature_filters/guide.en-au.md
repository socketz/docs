## Objective

With a filter you can configure conditions for your account's incoming emails and set actions based on them.

For example: you can automatically delete emails tagged as spam by our spam protection.

- Condition: email subject contains *[SPAM]*
- Action: delete email

**This guide explains how to create and configure a filter on your email address.**


## Requirements

- a [Web Hosting plan](https://www.ovh.com.au/web-hosting/){.external} 
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com.au/&ovhSubsidiary=au)


## Instructions

Log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com.au/&ovhSubsidiary=au) and select `Web Cloud`{.action} in the top navigation bar.

Select the domain name from the `Emails`{.action} section in the services bar on the left-hand side. Switch to the tab `Emails`{.action}.

In the table listing your email addresses, click on the `Filter`{.action} icon in the row of the email address concerned.

### Understanding the email filter settings

#### Information

- **Filter name:** This is used to differentiate your filters inside the Control Panel.
- **Priority:** This sets the order in which your filters will run for all emails received on this address. A Priority 1 filter will run before a Priority 5 filter.
- **Enable filter:** This determines whether the filter will be applied to the inbox (for example, you can temporarily disable a filter without deleting it by unchecking this option).


#### Rules

In this section you can configure the filter conditions, also known as inbox rules.

First choice (Header):

- **From**: Corresponds to the sender, example: `If the sender ...`.
- **To**: Corresponds to the recipient, example: `If the recipient ...`.
- **Message subject**: Matches the subject of the message, example: `If the subject of the message ...`.
- **Other**: Other parameter.

Second choice (Rule):

- **spf**: Parameter that depends on a domain's SPF, example: `... has no SPF record`.
- **includes**: Positive condition, example: `the subject contains ...`.
- **does not include**: Negative condition, example: `... does not contain ...`.

Third choice (Value):

- A concrete value to define this rule, for example: `[SPAM]`.

Fourth choice (+):

- This allows you to add more rules for the action defined below.

**Result of these rules**

- Example: `If the message subject contains [SPAM]`


#### Action

This is where you decide how the filter handles an email if the above conditions are met.

You can choose between these types of actions:

- **accept**: the email will stay in your inbox.
- **redirect to a local address**: redirects the email to one of your other email addresses on the same domain.
- **deletion**: deletes the email from your inbox without further notice.
- **redirect to a remote address**: redirects the email to whichever email address you enter.


### Examples

#### Deleting spam emails

||Header|Rule|Value|Action|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Filter settings|Message subject|includes|[SPAM]|deletion|
|What the filter will do|If the subject of the message|includes|the word `[SPAM]`|then delete the message.|


#### Redirecting emails from a certain sender

||Header|Rule|Value|Action|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Filter settings|From|includes|contact@domaintest.ovh|redirect to a remote address: jean@otherdomain.ovh|
|What the filter will do|If the sender|is|contact@domaintest.ovh|then redirect the email to jean@otherdomain.ovh|


#### Redirecting emails sent to a mailing list

||Header|Rule|Value|Action|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Filter settings|To|includes|ML@mailing.com|redirect to a local address: recipient@mypersonaldomain.ovh|
|What the filter will do|If the message was sent to the mailing list|called|ML@mailing.com|then redirect the message to my other address: recipient@mypersonaldomain.ovh|

<a name="MULTI"></a>

#### Deleting emails containing an unwanted phrase, excluding one sender 

This filter example consists of two rules:

||Header|Rule|Value|Action|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Filter settings 1|Message subject|includes|money|deletion|
|Filter settings 2|From|does not include|john@mybank.ovh|deletion|

**What the filter will do**: If the subject of the message contains the word `money` **and** the sender of the message is not `john@mybank.ovh`, then the message will be deleted.

In the Control Panel, the filter configuration looks like this:
