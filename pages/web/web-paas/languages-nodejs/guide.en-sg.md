## Objective  

Node.js is a popular JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.  Web PaaS supports deploying Node.js applications quickly and easily. Using our Multi-App support you can build a micro-service oriented system mixing both Javascript and PHP applications.


## Supported versions

| **Grid** | 
|----------------------------------|  
|  6 |  
|  8 |  
|  10 |  
|  12 |  
|  14 |  

If you need other versions, take a look at our [options for installing them with NVM](nvm).

## Deprecated versions

Some versions with a minor (such as 8.9) are available but are not receiving security updates from upstream, so their use is not recommended.

| **Grid** | 
|----------------------------------|  
|  0.12 |  
|  4.7 |  
|  4.8 |  
|  6.1 |  
|  6.9 |  
|  8.2 |  

## Build flavor

Node.js images use the `default` build flavor, which will run `npm prune --userconfig .npmrc && npm install --userconfig .npmrc` if a `package.json` file is detected. Note that this also allows you to provide a custom `.npmrc` file in the root of your application (as a sibling of the `.platform.app.yaml` file.)

## Support libraries

While it is possible to read the environment directly from your application, it is generally easier and more robust to use the [`platformsh-config`](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-nodejs) NPM library which handles decoding of service credential information for you.

## Configuration

To use Web PaaS and Node.js together, configure the `.platform.app.yaml` file with a few key settings, as described here (a complete example is included at the end).

1\. Specify the language of your application (available versions are listed above):



```yaml   
type: 'nodejs:14'
```  


2\. Specify your dependencies under the `nodejs` key, like this:


```yaml
dependencies:
  nodejs:
    pm2: "^4.5.0"
```

   These are the global dependencies of your project (the ones you would have installed with `npm install -g`). Here we specify the `pm2` process manager that will allow us to run the node process.

3\. Configure the command you use to start serving your application (this must be a foreground-running process) under the `web` section, e.g.:


```yaml
web:
  commands:
    start: "PM2_HOME=/app/run pm2 start index.js --no-daemon"
```

   If there is a package.json file present at the root of your repository, Web PaaS will automatically install the dependencies. We suggest including the `platformsh-config` helper npm module, which makes it trivial to access the running environment.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "platformsh-config": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

> [!primary]  
>   If using the `pm2` process manager to start your application, it is recommended that you do so directly in `web.commands.start` as described above, rather than by calling a separate script the contains that command. Calling `pm2 start` at `web.commands.start` from within a script, even with the `--no-daemon` flag, has been found to daemonize itself and block other processes (such as backups) with continuous respawns.
> 

4\. Create any Read/Write mounts. The root file system is read only. You must explicitly describe writable mounts. In (3) we set the home of the process manager to `/app/run` so this needs to be writable.


```yaml
mounts:
    run:
        source: local
        source_path: run
```

5\. Include any relevant commands needed to build and setup your application in the `hooks` section, e.g.:


```yaml
hooks:
  build: |
    npm install
    npm run build
```

6\. Setup the routes to your Node.js application in `.platform/routes.yaml`.


```yaml
"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "app:http"
```

7\. (Optional) If Web PaaS detects a `package.json` file in your repository, it will automatically include a `default` [`build` flavor](../configuration-app/build#build), that will run `npm prune --userconfig .npmrc && npm install --userconfig .npmrc`. You can modify that process to use an alternative package manager by including the following in your `.platform.app.yaml` file:


```yaml
build:
  flavor: none
```

   Consult the documentation specific to [Node.js builds](../configuration-app/build#nodejs-npm-by-default) for more information.


Here's a complete example that also serves static assets (.png from the `/public` directory):

```yaml
name: node
type: nodejs:14

web:
  commands:
    start: "PM2_HOME=/app/run pm2 start index.js --no-daemon"
    #in this setup you will find your application stdout and stderr in /app/run/logs
  locations:
    "/public":
      passthru: false
      root: "public"
      # Whether to allow files not matching a rule or not.
      allow: true
      rules:
        '\.png$':
          allow: true
          expires: -1
dependencies:
  nodejs:
    pm2: "^4.5.0"
mounts:
   run:
       source: local
       source_path: run
disk: 512
```

## In your application...

Finally, make sure your Node.js application is configured to listen over the port given by the environment (here we use the platformsh helper and get it from `config.port`) that is available in the environment variable ``PORT``.  Here's an example:

```js
// Load the http module to create an http server.
const http = require('http');

// Load the Web PaaS configuration
const config = require('platformsh-config').config();

const server = http.createServer(function (request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "application/json"});
  response.end(JSON.stringify(config));
});

server.listen(config.port);
```

## Accessing services

To access various [services](../configuration-services) with Node.js, see the following examples.  The individual service pages have more information on configuring each service.
