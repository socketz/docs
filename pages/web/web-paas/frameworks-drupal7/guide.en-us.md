## Structure your files

Web PaaS is very flexible and allows you to structure your files as you wish within your Git repository, and will build your project based on how your files are organized.

Here are the three build modes that can be used:

-   **Profile**: Web PaaS builds your project like Drupal.org does for distributions.

-   **Project**: Web PaaS builds your make file using *drush make*. You don't need any Drupal core files nor any contributed modules, themes or libraries within your Git repository.

-   **Vanilla**: Web PaaS builds your project as it is in your Git repository. You can push all Drupal files and contributed modules, themes or libraries.


### Profile mode

If your repository contains a `.profile` file, Web PaaS builds your project in profile mode. This is similar to what Drupal.org does to build distributions. Everything you have in your repository will be copied to your `profiles/[name]` folder.

This build mode supports having a `project.make` file for your contributed modules, themes or libraries.

> [!primary]  
> When building as a profile, you **need a make file for Drupal core** called: `project-core.make`. See
> [drush make files](drush).
> 

```text
.git/
project.make
project-core.make
my_profile.info
my_profile.install
my_profile.profile
modules/
  features/
    my_feature_01/
    ...
  custom/
    my_custom_module/
    ...
themes/
  custom/
    my_custom_theme/
    ...
libraries/
  custom/
    my_custom_libraries/
    ...
translations/
  ...
```

### Project mode

If your repository doesn't contain a `.profile` file, but contains a make file called: `project.make` (or even `drupal-org.make`), Web PaaS builds your project using Drush make. Everything you have in your repository will be copied to your `sites/default` folder.

```text
.git/
project.make
modules/
  features/
    my_feature_01/
    ...
  custom/
    my_custom_module/
    ...
themes/
  custom/
    my_custom_theme/
    ...
libraries/
  custom/
    my_custom_libraries/
    ...
translations/
  ...
```

### Vanilla mode

In Vanilla mode, Web PaaS just takes your repository as-is without any additional reorganization.  This is the behavior when there is no `.make` or `.profile` file, or when the build mode is set to `none` or `composer` rather than to `drupal`.

It's best to keep your docroot separate from your repository root, as that allows you to store private files outside of the docroot when needed.  For example, your repository layout will likely resemble the following:

```text
.git/
private/
web/
  index.php
  ... (other Drupal core files)
  sites/
    all/
      modules/
      themes/
    default/
```

If you already have a Drupal 7 site built from a `tar.gz` download from Drupal.org, this is likely the best path forward.

## Configuring Web PaaS for Drupal

The ideal `.platform.app.yaml` file will vary from project project, and you are free to customize yours as needed.  A recommended baseline Drupal 7 configuration is listed below, and can also be found in our [Drupal 7 template project](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal7) or [Drupal 7 vanilla template project](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal7-vanilla).
