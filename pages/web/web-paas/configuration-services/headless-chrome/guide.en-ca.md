## Objective  

Headless Chrome is a headless browser that can be configured on projects like any other service on Web PaaS.

You can interact with the `headless-chrome` service container using Puppeteer, a Node.js library that provides an API to control Chrome over the DevTools Protocol.

Puppeteer can be used to generate PDFs and screenshots of web pages, automate form submission, and test your project's UI. You can find out more information about using Puppeteer on [GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) or in their [documentation](https://pptr.dev/).

## Supported versions

| **Grid** | 
|----------------------------------|  
|  73 |  

## Relationship

The format exposed in the `$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` [environment variable](../../development-variables#platformsh-provided-variables):

```yaml
{
    "service": "headless",
    "ip": "169.254.73.96",
    "hostname": "3rxha4e2w4yv36lqlypy7qlkza.headless.service._.eu-3.platformsh.site",
    "cluster": "moqwtrvgc63mo-master-7rqtwti",
    "host": "headless.internal",
    "rel": "http",
    "scheme": "http",
    "type": "chrome-headless:73",
    "port": 9222
}
```

## Requirements

Puppeteer requires at least Node.js version 6.4.0, while using the async and await examples below requires Node 7.6.0 or greater.

Using the Web PaaS [Config Reader](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-nodejs) library requires Node.js 10 or later.

### Other languages

It will be necessary to upgrade the version of Node.js in other language containers before using Puppeteer. You can use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or NVM to change or update the version available in your application container by following the instructions in the [Alternate Node.js install](../../languages-nodejs/nvm) documentation.

## Usage example

In your `.platform/services.yaml`:


```yaml   
headlessbrowser:
    type: chrome-headless:73
```  


In your `.platform.app.yaml`:


```yaml   
relationships:
    chromeheadlessbrowser: "headlessbrowser:http"
```  

> You will need to use `chrome-headless` type when defining the service
>
> ```yaml
> # .platform/services.yaml
> service_name:
>  	type: chrome-headless:version
> ```
>
> and the endpoint `http` when defining the relationship
>
> ```yaml
> # .platform.app.yaml
>  relationships:
>    	relationship_name: “service_name:http”
> ```
>
> Your service_name and relationship_name are defined by you, but we recommend making them distinct from each other.
>

After configuration, include Puppeteer as a dependency in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "puppeteer": "^1.14.0"
  }
}
```

Using the [Node.js Config Reader](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-nodejs) library, you can retrieve formatted credentials for connecting to headless Chrome with Puppeteer:

```js
const platformsh = require('platformsh-config');

const config = platformsh.config();
const credentials = config.credentials('chromeheadlessbrowser');
```

and use them to define the `browserURL` parameter of `puppeteer.connect()` within an `async` function:

```js
exports.takeScreenshot = async function (url) {
    try {
        // Connect to chrome-headless using pre-formatted puppeteer credentials
        const formattedURL = config.formattedCredentials('chromeheadlessbrowser', 'puppeteer');
        const browser = await puppeteer.connect({browserURL: formattedURL});

        ...

        return browser

    } catch (error) {
        console.error({ error }, 'Something happened!');
        browser.close();
    }
};
```

Puppeteer allows your application to [create screenshots](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v1.17.0&show=api-pagescreenshotoptions), [emulate a mobile device](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v1.17.0&show=api-pageemulateoptions), [generate PDFs](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v1.17.0&show=api-pagepdfoptions), and much more.
