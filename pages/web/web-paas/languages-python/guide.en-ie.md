## Objective  

Web PaaS supports deploying Python applications. Your application can use WSGI-based (Gunicorn / uWSGI) application server, Tornado, Twisted, or Python 3.5+ asyncio server.

## Supported

| **Grid** | 
|----------------------------------|  
|  2.7 |  
|  3.5 |  
|  3.6 |  
|  3.7 |  
|  3.8 |  
|  3.9 |  

## Support libraries

While it is possible to read the environment directly from your application, it is generally easier and more robust to use the [`platformshconfig`](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-python) pip library which handles decoding of service credential information for you.

## WSGI-based configuration

In this example, we use Gunicorn to run our WSGI application.  Configure the `.platform.app.yaml` file with a few key settings as listed below, a complete example is included at the end of this section.

1\. Specify the language of your application (available versions are listed above):



```yaml   
type: 'python:3.9'
```  


2\. Build your application with the build hook. Assuming you have your pip dependencies stored in `requirements.txt` and a `setup.py` at the root of your application folder to execute build steps:


```yaml
hooks:
  build: |
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .
    pip install gunicorn
```

   These are installed as global dependencies in your environment.

3\. Configure the command you use to start serving your application (this must be a foreground-running process) under the `web` section, e.g.:


```yaml
web:
  commands:
    start: "gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT project.wsgi:application"
```

   This assumes the WSGI file is `project/wsgi.py` and the WSGI application object is named `application` in the WSGI file.

4\. Define the web locations your application is using:


```yaml
web:
  locations:
    "/":
      root: ""
      passthru: true
      allow: false
    "/static":
      root: "static/"
      allow: true
```

   This configuration asks our web server to handle HTTP requests at "/static" to serve static files stored in `/app/static/` folder while everything else is forwarded to your application server.

5\. Create any Read/Write mounts. The root file system is read only.  You must explicitly describe writable mounts.


```yaml
mounts:
    tmp:
        source: local
        source_path: tmp
    logs:
        source: local
        source_path: logs
```

   This setting allows your application writing files to `/app/tmp` and have logs stored in `/app/logs`.

Then, set up the routes to your application in `.platform/routes.yaml`.

```yaml
"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "app:http"
```

Here is the complete `.platform.app.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: app
type: python:2.7

web:
  commands:
    start: "gunicorn -b $PORT project.wsgi:application"
  locations:
    "/":
      root: ""
      passthru: true
      allow: false
    "/static":
      root: "static/"
      allow: true

hooks:
  build: |
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .
    pip install gunicorn

mounts:
   tmp:
       source: local
       source_path: tmp
   logs:
       source: local
       source_path: logs

disk: 512
```

## Using the asyncio module

The above Gunicorn based WSGI example can be modified to use the Python 3.5+ asyncio module.

1\. Change the `type` to `python:3.6`.

2\. Change the start command to use asyncio.


```yaml
web:
  commands:
    start: "gunicorn -b $PORT -k gaiohttp project.wsgi:application"
```

3\. Add `aiohttp` as pip dependency in your build hook.


```yaml
hooks:
  build: |
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .
    pip install gunicorn aiohttp
```

## Accessing services

To access various [services](../configuration-services) with Python, see the following examples.  The individual service pages have more information on configuring each service.
