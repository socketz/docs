## Objective  

To delete a Web PaaS project, including all data, code, and active environments:

* Go to your Account Settings, logging in if necessary, via the link in the top-right corner of these docs, or via this link: [https://accounts.platform.sh/user](https://accounts.platform.sh/user).
* Locate the project you wish to delete in the project list.
* Hover the gear icon on the project and select "Delete".
* Confirm your intent to delete the project.

> [!primary]  
> Only the "Owner" of a project has the ability to delete that project. 
> 

You will only be billed for the portion of a month during which the project was active.  If you delete a project part way through the month the cost of the project will be prorated accordingly.

A user account with no projects associated with it will have no charges.
