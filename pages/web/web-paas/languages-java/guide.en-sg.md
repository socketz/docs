## Objective  

Java is a general-purpose programming language, and one of the most popular in the world today. Web PaaS supports Java runtimes that can be used with build management tools such as Gradle, Maven, and Ant.

## Supported versions

### OpenJDK versions:

| **Grid** | 
|----------------------------------|  
|  11 |  
|  12 |  
|  8 |  
|  13 |  
|  14 |  

To specify a Java container, use the `type` property in your `.platform.app.yaml`.


```yaml   
type: 'java:14'
```  


## Support libraries

While it is possible to read the environment directly from your application, it is generally easier and more robust to use the [`platformsh/config-reader`](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-java) which handles decoding of service credential information for you.

## Support build automation

Web PaaS supports the most common project management tools in the Java ecosystem, including:

* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Ant](https://ant.apache.org/)

## Other JVM languages

It’s worth remembering that the JVM by its specification [does not read Java code](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/index.html), but bytecode. So within the JVM, it’s possible to [run several languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages). Web PaaS supports several of them, such as Kotlin, Groovy, and Scala, so long as that language works with any build automation that Web PaaS supports.
