## Objective  

Full Drush support and Composer-based builds make handling dependencies and builds for PHP frameworks as simple as committing your `composer.json` to your project.


## Drupal

[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) is an open-source content management framework written in PHP. Since Composer comes pre-installed on Web PaaS, Drupal can be installed and updated completely using Composer. The default [build flavor](../../overview-build-deploy#building-the-application) for PHP application runs `composer install` during build, handling all of your dependencies automatically.
