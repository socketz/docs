## Objective 

This document describes the way for sending emails from your application.

## SMTP Ports configuration
TCP port 25 is blocked for security reasons; use TCP port 465 or 587 instead.

## Choosing an email service
WebPaaS doesn't provide an integrated service for sending emails.
You must choose a third-party provider such as Tipimail, Mailjet, or Sendinblue.

For compliance and sovereignty reason, OVHcloud would recommend using Tipimail solution.

## Tipimail registration
Tipimail provides a free tier of 10000 emails/month.
You can register at [https://www.tipimail.com/](https://www.tipimail.com/)

There are two possibilities, either using the Tipimail API, or the SMTP configuration.
For the SMTP, you must connect to the TCP port 587.
